# User Management System ( Serverless )

My first Serverless application which provides the CRUD operation on User Management System.

- The home page list all the users in database.
- The Registration page will register the user in database and returns the response if user registered successfully OR the user already exists.
- In login page, if the email and password entered by user are correct, then lambda will return the Username of user as a acknowledgement that the credentials are correct.

## Tools Used

- AWS Lambda ( Python ) for the backend
- API Gateway ( REST API )
- DynamoDB for Database
- ReactJS for the front-end
